            <b><p>THE PLACENTA MANIFESTO</p></b>
<p>IN THE WORLD OF GAMES, THERE HAS BEEN A LONG KNOWN ERA OF INDIE GAMES WHERE EXPERIMENTATION AND NONSENSE REIGNS, WHERE INDIE GAMES ARE FILLED WITH MOSTLY INSIDE JOKES. IN THIS DAY AND AGE, MOST INDIE GAMES FOCUS ON STORY, WHETHER GOOD OR BAD. AND THOUGH A GOOD STORY CAN CREATE WONDERFUL RESULTS, LONG GONE ARE THE DAYS OF NONSENSE, WHERE HAVING A GOOD GAME IS OPTIONAL, WHERE IT WAS MADE, SIMPLY BECAUSE IT CAN</p>

<p>GAMES LIKE &&, SEXY HIKING, INTELLIGENT RACKETY PARADISE, WHERE POLISH AND COHERENT STORY IS THE LAST THING THEY TRY TO FOCUS ON, AND MORE ON EXPLORING STRANGE ODD WORLDS AND CONCEPTS ARE NOW GONE AND REPLACED WITH NEW GAMES TRYING TO BREAK THE MOLD, OR GAMES TRYING TO BE BETTER THAN IT REALLY IS</p>

<p>THIS HAS RESULTED IN SOME PROBLEMS, HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT ALMOST EVERY GAME FEELS THE SAME, THE SAME COZY GAME, THE SAME HORROR GAME, ALL WITH DIFFERENT SKIN, BUT THE SAME FLESH, ALL WITH DIFFERENT PLACENTAS, BUT THE SAME FETUS</p>

<b><p>EXPERIMENTATION OVER STORY</p></b>

<p>PLACENTA STUDIO BELIEVES THAT EXPERIMENTATION TRIUMPHS OVER A GOOD STORY. YES, GOOD GAMES MAY HAVE AMAZING STORIES, BUT LONG GONE ARE THERE STRANGE ODD GAMES WHERE STORY IS SECOND HAND, AND THERE IS MORE FOCUS ON STRANGE MECHANICS, OR ODD GAMEPLAY LOOPS</p>

<b><p>NONSENSE REIGNS</p></b>
<p>COHERENT STORIES CAN CREATE AMAZING RESULTS, BUT PLACENTA STUDIO BELIEVES THAT NONSENSE AND CHAOS REIGNS IN THE WORLD OF THE UNPOLISHED. A STORY MAY HAVE A COHERENT LINE OF THOUGHT, BUT IT SHOULD NEVER BE THE MAIN POINT, ONLY AN OPTION, OR A SYMPTOM MID DEVELOPMENT</p>

<b><p>POLISH IS OPTIONAL</p></b>
<p>WE CAN SPEND HOURS TRYING TO FINISH UP A PERFECT GAME AND PUT IT OUT IN THE WORLD, BUT POLISH IS ONLY A DETRIMENT TO NONSENSE, POLISH WILL NOT BE THE FOCUS, BUT A CHOICE</p>

<p>PLACENTA STUDIO BELIEVES IN THE IDEOLOGY THAT GAMES SHOULDNT BE FORCED TO FOLLOW STRICT RULES. THAT IF A GAME IS FINISHED BROKEN, UNLESS NECESSARY, IT SHALL STAY BROKEN. THAT IF A GAME IS POINTLESS, IT SHALL STAY POINTLESS. THAT IF IT IS NONSENSE, THEN IT WILL STAY NONSENSE. THAT IF A GAME CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD BY A SMALL GROUP, IT WILL ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD BY A SMALL GROUP</p>

<p>WE ARE NOT CLAIMING TO BE THE NEXT BEST THING, WE ARE FAR FROM THAT</p>
